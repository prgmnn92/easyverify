                      <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other reasons.</p>
                      <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>
                      <p>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</p>
                      <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. We may experience delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on other web sites. The information found on the Service may contain errors or inaccuracies and may not be complete or current. Products or services may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable on the Service and we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information found on the Service.</p>
                      <p>We therefore reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>
                      <p>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</p>
                      <p>Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms &amp; Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, the Promotion rules will apply.</p>
                      <p>Subscriptions</p>
                      <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)”). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
                      <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Simpleverify.co cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Simpleverify.co customer support team.</p>
                      <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Simpleverify.co with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Simpleverify.co to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                      <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Simpleverify.co will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
                      <p>Free Trial</p>
                      <p>Simpleverify.co may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”).</p>
                      <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
                      <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Simpleverify.co until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
                      <p>At any time and without notice, Simpleverify.co reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
                      <p>Fee Changes</p>
                      <p>Simpleverify.co, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
                      <p>Simpleverify.co will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
                      <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
                      <p>Refunds</p>
                      <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
                      <p>Accounts</p>
                      <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that the information you provide us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate, incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account on the Service.</p>
                      <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, including but not limited to the restriction of access to your computer and/or account.

                      <p>We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in our sole discretion.</p>
                      <p>Links To Other Web Sites</p>
                      <p>Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Simpleverify.co</p>
                      <p>Simpleverify.co has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.</p>

                      <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third party web sites or services that you visit.</p>
                      <p>Termination</p>
                      <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.</p>
                      <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
                      <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>
                      <p>Governing Law</p>
                      <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                      <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service.</p>
                      <p>Changes</p>
                      <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
                      <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.<br></p>
                      <p>Opt-Out of Arbitration/Class Action Waiver. The Terms &amp; Conditions do not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these Dispute Resolution Provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on the simpleverify.co website.</p>
